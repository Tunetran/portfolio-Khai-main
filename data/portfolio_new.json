      "content": "Nmap (Network Mapper) is the cornerstone tool for network discovery and security auditing. As an ethical hacker and penetration tester, mastering advanced Nmap techniques is crucial for effective reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.\n\n## 🚀 **Advanced Scanning Techniques**\n\n### **Stealth Scanning Methods**\n```bash\n# SYN Stealth Scan (Most common)\nnmap -sS target.com\n\n# TCP ACK Scan (Firewall detection)\nnmap -sA target.com\n\n# TCP Window Scan\nnmap -sW target.com\n\n# TCP Maimon Scan\nnmap -sM target.com\n```\n\n### **Advanced Service Detection**\n```bash\n# Aggressive service detection\nnmap -sV --version-intensity 9 target.com\n\n# OS fingerprinting with service detection\nnmap -A target.com\n\n# Script scanning for vulnerabilities\nnmap --script vuln target.com\n```\n\n## 🎯 **NSE Scripts for Security Testing**\n\n### **Web Application Testing**\n```bash\n# HTTP enumeration\nnmap --script http-enum target.com\n\n# SQL injection detection\nnmap --script http-sql-injection target.com\n\n# XSS detection\nnmap --script http-stored-xss,http-dombased-xss target.com\n```\n\n### **SMB/NetBIOS Testing**\n```bash\n# SMB vulnerability scanning\nnmap --script smb-vuln-* target.com\n\n# SMB enumeration\nnmap --script smb-enum-* target.com\n\n# Check for EternalBlue\nnmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 target.com\n```\n\n## 🔍 **Advanced Evasion Techniques**\n\n### **Firewall and IDS Evasion**\n```bash\n# Fragment packets\nnmap -f target.com\n\n# Use decoys\nnmap -D RND:10 target.com\n\n# Source port manipulation\nnmap --source-port 53 target.com\n\n# Timing templates\nnmap -T0 target.com  # Paranoid (very slow)\nnmap -T5 target.com  # Insane (very fast)\n```\n\n### **Advanced Output and Reporting**\n```bash\n# Multiple output formats\nnmap -oA comprehensive_scan target.com\n\n# XML output for parsing\nnmap -oX scan_results.xml target.com\n\n# Grepable output\nnmap -oG scan_results.gnmap target.com\n```\n\n## 💡 **Professional Tips**\n\n1. **Always scan responsibly** - Only scan networks you own or have explicit permission to test\n2. **Use timing templates** appropriately based on network conditions\n3. **Combine multiple techniques** for comprehensive reconnaissance\n4. **Document everything** for professional reporting\n5. **Stay updated** with latest NSE scripts and techniques\n\n## ⚠️ **Legal and Ethical Considerations**\n\n- Obtain proper authorization before scanning\n- Respect rate limits and network resources\n- Follow responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities\n- Comply with local laws and regulations\n\nNmap is incredibly powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility. Use these techniques ethically and professionally in your cybersecurity career!",

Configure layout for specific analysis tasks\n2. Set up custom coloring rules\n3. Define frequently used filters\n4. Export/import profiles for team consistency\n\n### **Command Line Analysis (tshark)**\n```bash\n# Extract credentials from HTTP traffic\ntshark -r capture.pcap -Y \"http.request.method==POST\" -T fields -e http.file_data\n\n# DNS query extraction\ntshark -r capture.pcap -Y \"dns.qry.type==1\" -T fields -e dns.qry.name\n\n# Suspicious file extraction\ntshark -r capture.pcap --export-objects http,extracted_files/\n```\n\n## 💡 **Professional Best Practices**\n\n1. **Chain of Custody**: Maintain proper documentation\n2. **Performance Optimization**: Use capture filters for large captures\n3. **Privacy Protection**: Anonymize sensitive data before sharing\n4. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated with new protocol dissectors\n\n## 🚨 **Legal and Privacy Considerations**\n\n- Ensure proper authorization for network monitoring\n- Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)\n- Implement proper data retention policies\n- Secure capture files containing sensitive data\n\nWireshark is an invaluable tool for cybersecurity professionals.
